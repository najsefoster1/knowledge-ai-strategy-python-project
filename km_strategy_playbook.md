# Knowledge Management & AI Strategy Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook describes a comprehensive framework for transforming disparate knowledge into AI ready assets and embedding knowledge management (KM) as a cross‑functional discipline across Customer Experience (CX), Product, Engineering, and Marketing. It is designed to reduce cost‑to‑serve, accelerate onboarding, and scale customer success by making knowledge the fuel for AI agents, automation, and intelligent search.

## 1. Strategy & Governance
- **Vision**: Create a unified knowledge backbone that powers automation, intelligent search, chatbots, and AI agents across the customer lifecycle.
- **Governance Standards**: Define clear ownership, review cadence, and approval workflows for knowledge assets. Implement content lifecycle processes (create → review → publish → archive).
- **Taxonomy & Metadata**: Develop a controlled vocabulary and metadata schema (see `taxonomy.yaml`) to enable consistent classification and retrieval. Metadata fields include audience, product area, intent, last_updated, and source_system.
- **Alignment with GTM**: Ensure that knowledge content aligns with the organisation’s positioning, messaging, and go‑to‑market strategy.

## 2. Cross‑Functional Embedding
- **Roles & Responsibilities**: Assign explicit roles such as Knowledge Authors, Subject Matter Experts, Taxonomy Owner, and KM Program Manager. Clarify responsibilities for content creation, review, curation, and compliance.
- **Community of Practice**: Establish a matrixed community of KM champions across CX, Product, Engineering, and Marketing to maintain standards and share best practices.
- **Process Integration**: Integrate KM tasks into existing workflows (e.g., product release checklists, support ticket workflows, marketing campaigns) to make knowledge capture a natural part of daily work.

## 3. AI & Automation Enablement
- **AI Readiness**: Prepare knowledge assets for machine ingestion by enforcing structured formats (Markdown, JSON) and metadata. Use ingestion scripts (see `scripts/knowledge_ingestion.py`) to transform raw documents into structured JSON for training or retrieval.
- **Collaboration with AI/ML Teams**: Partner with data scientists and ML engineers to ensure that knowledge corpora are suitable for model training, embedding generation, and retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG).
- **Use Cases**: Identify high‑impact use cases such as conversational agents for customer support, automated route recommendations during onboarding, and recommendation engines for internal enablement.

## 4. Change & Adoption
- **Change Management**: Communicate the strategic importance of KM through leadership briefings, roadshows, and onboarding sessions. Tie KM contributions to performance reviews and recognition programs.
- **Training**: Provide training on content standards, taxonomy usage, and authoring tools. Offer office hours and documentation to support adoption.
- **Metrics & Continuous Improvement**: Track KPIs such as ticket deflection rate, AI agent resolution %, search success rate, onboarding cycle time, and content freshness. Use these insights to refine processes and identify gaps.

## 5. Content Lifecycle Workflow
1. **Authoring**: Knowledge Authors create or update content using approved templates and metadata.
2. **Review**: SMEs and Taxonomy Owner review for accuracy, compliance, and tagging.
3. **Publishing**: Approved content is published to the knowledge base and indexed for search and AI consumption.
4. **Monitoring**: Usage analytics and feedback are collected to gauge effectiveness.
5. **Archival or Refresh**: Content is periodically reviewed and either archived or updated to ensure relevance.

## Conclusion
A robust KM & AI strategy requires clear governance, cross‑functional alignment, structured taxonomies, and AI‑ready processes. By following this playbook, organisations can transform knowledge into a strategic asset that unlocks automation, improves customer satisfaction, and drives operational efficiency.
