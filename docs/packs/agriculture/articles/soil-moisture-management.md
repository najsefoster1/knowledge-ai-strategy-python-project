# Soil Moisture Management Strategies

## Overview
Good soil moisture management supports yield, plant health, and efficient input use. This article explains how to monitor soil moisture, set thresholds, and adjust irrigation.

## Monitoring
- Use soil moisture sensors (tensiometers or capacitance probes) at multiple depths.
- Log readings daily during peak growth; weekly otherwise.
- Track recent rainfall and evapotranspiration alongside soil readings.

## Thresholds & Irrigation Guidelines
- Set crop- and soil-specific trigger points (e.g., VWC < 18% in sandy loam).
- Irrigate in shorter, more frequent cycles to reduce runoff.
- Verify infiltration with post-irrigation spot checks.

## Drought Mitigation
- Prioritize critical growth stages (flowering/fruit set).
- Add mulching where feasible.
- Re-baseline thresholds following heat waves.

## Governance
- Review content every 45 days in active season; 90 days in off-season.
