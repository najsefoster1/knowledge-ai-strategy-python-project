# Agriculture Pack Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook provides guidelines for generating and curating agronomic advisories, including planting schedules, fertilization plans, irrigation management, pest control, and harvest timing. The aim is to deliver domain-specific knowledge and decision support for crop producers and agronomists.

## Decision Areas
- **Planting schedules:** recommended planting dates based on crop, region, and weather forecast.
- **Fertilization:** nutrient management plans, application rates, and timing.
- **Irrigation management:** soil moisture monitoring, watering schedules, and drought mitigation.
- **Pest and disease control:** integrated pest management (IPM) practices, detection thresholds, and treatment options.
- **Harvest timing:** optimal harvest windows, maturity indicators, and yield optimization.

## Cadence & Freshness
Agronomic advisories should be reviewed weekly during active growth seasons and at least monthly during dormancy. Updates must be published within 48 hours when new research, regulatory changes, or weather-driven triggers affect recommendations.

## Governance & Approval
**Authors:** Agronomy SMEs create and update content following the taxonomy and metadata standards in `taxonomy.yaml`.
**Reviewers:** Peer agronomists and QA editors check accuracy, clarity, and PII compliance.
**Approvers:** Product owners sign off final recommendations before publication.

## Usage
Use this playbook as a reference when creating or updating agricultural knowledge articles. Follow the decision areas above, adhere to the cadence and approval workflow, and cross-reference recommended practices with local regulations.
