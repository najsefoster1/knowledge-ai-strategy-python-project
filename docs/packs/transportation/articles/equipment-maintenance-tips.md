# Equipment Maintenance Tips

## Overview
Regular equipment maintenance ensures your fleet of snowplows, salt spreaders, and other winter operations equipment remains reliable and efficient throughout the season.

## Maintenance Tips
1. Conduct pre-season inspections for mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical systems.
2. Lubricate moving parts and check fluid levels before each shift.
3. Inspect cutting edges, plow blades, and spreader chains for wear; replace as needed.
4. Test and calibrate controllers and sensors to ensure accurate material application.
5. Clean equipment after each event to prevent corrosion from salt and chemicals.

## Safety Considerations
- Always follow lockout/tagout procedures during maintenance.
- Use proper personal protective equipment (PPE) when servicing equipment.
- Keep maintenance records to track issues and schedule preventative maintenance.
