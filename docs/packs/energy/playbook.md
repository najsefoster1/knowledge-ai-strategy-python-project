# Energy Pricing Playbook

## Purpose
Provides downstream pricing guidelines and risk guardrails for energy product management teams.

## Pricing Strategy
- Monitor market benchmarks (e.g., NYMEX, Platts) and supplier indices to determine base rack prices.
- Adjust prices based on local terminal inventory levels and transportation costs.
- Apply margin targets for each customer segment (retail, wholesale, dealer).
- Use dynamic pricing windows (e.g., daily, intraday) to capture market volatility.

## Risk Flags and Alerts
- **Rapid price change (> X cents)**: triggers immediate review by pricing manager.
- **Inventory shortage**: if terminal inventory falls below threshold, apply premium and notify supply chain.
- **Regulatory changes**: monitor announcements affecting fuel tax or biofuel mandates.

## Cadence
- **Daily updates**: adjust rack prices at the start of day using previous day's closing data.
- **Intraday adjustments**: during high volatility, update prices midday.
- **Weekly review**: evaluate pricing strategy effectiveness and adjust margins.

## Approval Workflow
1. Pricing analyst prepares proposed adjustments.
2. Pricing manager reviews and approves changes within policy thresholds.
3. Finance ensures margin targets are met.
4. Communications team publishes updated prices to customers.
