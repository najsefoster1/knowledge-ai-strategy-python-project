# Monitoring Risk Signals

## Overview
This article outlines how to monitor key risk signals in downstream energy operations, enabling proactive price adjustments and supply chain coordination.

## Key Risk Signals
- **Price Volatility:** Track rapid changes in commodity futures and spot markets; define thresholds for escalation.
- **Inventory Levels:** Monitor terminal and pipeline inventory; low levels may trigger pricing premiums or supply reallocations.
- **Demand Shifts:** Watch for demand spikes or drops due to weather events, regulatory announcements, or competitor actions.
- **Credit Risk:** Evaluate customer credit exposure and adjust payment terms accordingly.
- **Operational Disruptions:** Include refinery outages, pipeline shutdowns, or transportation strikes.

## Response Actions
- Set automated alerts when risk thresholds are breached.
- Convene cross-functional risk review meetings for major events.
- Document decisions and rationale for audit purposes.
