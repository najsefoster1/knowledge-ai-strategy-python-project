# Knowledge & AI Strategy Demonstration

## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive Knowledge Management (KM) and AI readiness framework aligned with the requirements of a Knowledge & AI Strategy Lead role. It includes a structured taxonomy, governance standards, ingestion scripts, and documentation for cross‑functional adoption. The goal is to transform disparate knowledge assets into AI‑ready data that powers intelligent agents, automation, and customer experiences.

## Features
- **KM Strategy Playbook**: A detailed guide covering strategy, governance, taxonomies, content lifecycle, and cross‑functional roles.
- **Taxonomy Definition**: A YAML file defining categories, metadata fields, and tagging standards for knowledge assets.
- **Knowledge Ingestion Script**: A Python script that parses raw documents, applies metadata, and outputs structured JSON ready for AI training and retrieval.
- **Sample Data & Docs**: Example knowledge articles and metrics definitions to illustrate how the framework works in practice.
- **KPIs & Metrics**: Template for measuring AI‑linked KM performance (ticket deflection %, AI agent resolution %, search success rates, onboarding cycle time).

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository and install the required Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Review the `km_strategy_playbook.md` for background on the KM strategy and governance approach.
3. Customize the `taxonomy.yaml` to reflect your organisation’s domain and content.
4. Place your raw knowledge documents in `data/sample_knowledge` and run `scripts/knowledge_ingestion.py` to generate structured output.
5. Use the resulting JSON to feed into AI agents, chatbots, search indexes, or analytics pipelines.
