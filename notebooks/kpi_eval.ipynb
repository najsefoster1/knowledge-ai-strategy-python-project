    "This notebook demonstrates how to compute key AI-linked KPIs from synthetic events data. The metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ticket deflection %** – The share of customer intents resolved via self‑service or bots.\n",
    "- **AI agent resolution %** – The percentage of bot-handled interactions resolved without human escalation.\n",
    "- **Search success rate** – The proportion of searches that returned a useful result.\n",
    "- **Onboarding time‑to‑value (TTV)** – The average number of days between user sign‑up and first successful task.\n",
    "- **Article freshness** – The percentage of knowledge articles updated within the SLA window (e.g., 90 days).\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume you have a `synthetic_events.csv` file in the `data` directory with event logs for searches, bot interactions, and onboarding milestones. The code below illustrates how to load the data and compute these metrics using pandas.\n"
