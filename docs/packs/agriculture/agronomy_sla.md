## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Authors:** Agronomy SMEs responsible for drafting and updating content.
- **Reviewers:** Peer agronomists and QA editors verifying accuracy and clarity.
- **Approvers:** Product owners and regulatory compliance reviewers sign off before publishing.

## Freshness Standards

- Content must be updated whenever significant agronomic developments occur.
- Articles older than 90 days should be flagged for review.
- Metadata `last_updated` field in the YAML front matter must reflect the latest revision date.

## Archival

- Retire outdated advisories when superseded by new research or changes in regulations.
