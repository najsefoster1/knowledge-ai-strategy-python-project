# Pricing Guardrails and Alerts

## Thresholds
- **Max daily price change:** Â±X cents per gallon. Changes beyond this threshold require pricing manager approval.
- **Minimum margin floor:** ensure minimum gross margin of Y cents per gallon for all rack sales; alerts triggered when margin dips below this floor.
- **Volume exception:** deviations from contracted volume greater than 10% must be approved by supply chain.

## Alerts and Escalation
- When a threshold is breached, automatically notify the pricing manager and supply chain via email and dashboard alert.
- If a threshold breach persists for more than two hours, escalation to the director of pricing is required.
- Document all override approvals and track rationale for auditing.

## Monitoring
- The price analytics system should run checks hourly during trading hours.
- Inventory and supply data should be integrated to adjust thresholds in real time.
- Generate weekly reports summarizing threshold breaches and response actions.

## Communication
- Publish updated prices and any surcharges to customers within 30 minutes of approval.
- Coordinate with customer service and sales to inform large customers of unusual price movements.
