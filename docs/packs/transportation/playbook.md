# Winter Operations Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook outlines procedures for transportation maintenance teams to make data-driven decisions in winter weather conditions. It includes a decision tree for selecting roadway treatments and audit points for compliance.

## Decision Tree
1. Assess current road surface temperature and precipitation type (snow, ice, freezing rain).
2. If road temperature below -10째C and ice present: apply pre-treatment with sand and anti-icing agent.
3. If road temperature between -10째C and 0째C and snow forecast within 2 hours: deploy plow crews and apply salt brine.
4. If temperature above 0째C but freezing rain expected: monitor conditions; apply anti-icing agent if surfaces begin to freeze.
5. After initial treatment, monitor road sensors every 30 minutes and reapply as needed.

## Audit Points
- Record temperature, precipitation type, and treatment applied at each decision point.
- Verify salt and sand application rates against standard guidelines.
- Ensure equipment calibration logs are up to date.
- Document crew call-out times and response durations.

## Service Levels
- Major highways cleared within 2 hours after snowfall stops.
- Secondary roads treated within 4 hours.
- Critical intersections and access points prioritized.
