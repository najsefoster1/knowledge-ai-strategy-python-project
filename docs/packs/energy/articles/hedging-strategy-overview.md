# Hedging Strategy Overview

## Purpose
Outline the objectives and instruments used in hedging fuel price risk for downstream operations to protect margins against volatility.

## Hedging Instruments

- **Futures contracts**: Standardized agreements to buy or sell fuel at a future date and price. Useful for locking in prices and reducing exposure.
- **Swaps**: Agreements to exchange floating price exposure for fixed price payments. Ideal for hedging basis differentials.
- **Options**: Contracts giving the right but not the obligation to buy or sell at a preset price. Provide asymmetric protection with premium costs.
- **Physical storage**: Holding inventory when forward curves are backwardated can be an effective hedge, but requires capacity and capital.

## Policy Guidelines

1. Determine hedge coverage targets (e.g., percentage of expected volume) based on risk appetite and market outlook.
2. Align hedging tenor with anticipated exposure duration and inventory cycles.
3. Adhere to credit limits and counterparty exposure limits; use approved brokers only.
4. Document hedge rationale, trade details, and approvals for audit compliance.
5. Monitor hedge effectiveness and adjust positions as market conditions evolve.

## Governance

Hedging activities should follow a documented policy approved by leadership. The risk management team collaborates with finance, supply, and trading to evaluate strategies and ensure compliance with regulations and internal controls.
