# Salt Application Best Practices

## Overview
This article provides guidelines on how to apply de-icing salt effectively during winter operations to ensure road safety and optimize resource usage.

## Best Practices
1. Calibrate spreaders to deliver the appropriate application rate based on pavement temperature and precipitation type.
2. Apply salt early in the storm to prevent bond formation between snow and pavement.
3. Avoid over-application to minimize environmental impact and material waste.
4. Use pre-wetting liquids to enhance salt efficiency and reduce bounce and scatter.
5. Adjust application rates based on traffic volume and road geometry.

## Additional Tips
- Monitor road surface temperature sensors to guide application decisions.
- Keep salt storage areas covered and dry to maintain material quality.
- Provide operator training on equipment calibration and optimal application rates.
