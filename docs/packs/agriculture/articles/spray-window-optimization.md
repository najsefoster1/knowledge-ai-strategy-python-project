# Spray Window Optimization for Fungicide Application

## Overview
Optimizing spray windows ensures that fungicide applications are timely and effective. Weather, crop growth stage, and disease pressure must be considered to maximize efficacy and minimize environmental impact.

## Factors to Consider
- **Weather conditions:** Avoid spraying during high winds (>10 mph), immediately before rain, or when temperatures exceed 30°C.
- **Crop growth stage:** Apply fungicides at key growth stages (e.g., V6–VT for corn, R1–R3 for soybeans) to maximize protection.
- **Disease thresholds:** Monitor disease incidence and apply when economic thresholds are reached.
- **Equipment calibration:** Ensure sprayer nozzles, pressure, and boom height provide uniform coverage.

## Recommended Steps
1. Check forecast for a 24-hour window with low wind speeds and no precipitation.
2. Assess crop stage and disease pressure in the field.
3. Calibrate sprayer equipment according to product label guidelines.
4. Apply fungicide within the recommended window and document the application.

## Additional Resources
Refer to local extension service guidelines and integrated pest management recommendations for specific crop and disease scenarios.
