# Growth Stage Monitoring for Crop Management

## Overview
Systematic phenology tracking improves timing for irrigation, fertilization, and crop protection.

## How to Monitor
- Record growth stage twice weekly using a standard scale (e.g., BBCH).
- Add photo references and notes in field logs.
- Flag weather-driven stage accelerations (heat, warm nights).

## Decisions by Stage
- **Vegetative**: nitrogen top-dress windows; irrigation ramp schedules.
- **Flowering**: fungicide timing; stress avoidance windows.
- **Maturity**: harvest readiness checks; desiccation planning.

## Governance
- Owners update stage guidance within 5 days of agronomy changes.
- KM verifies taxonomy and freshness every 90 days.
